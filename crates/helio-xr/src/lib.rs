//! OpenXR (Vulkan) integration for the Helio engine.
//!
//! This crate adapts a wgpu-backed (Vulkan) renderer to an OpenXR session:
//!
//! - [`instance`] / [`XrInstance`]: runtime + system + graphics-requirement
//!   negotiation.
//! - [`session`] / [`XrSession`]: session lifecycle, spaces, event pumping and
//!   the frame begin/end flow.
//! - [`swapchain`] / [`XrSwapchain`]: swapchain creation and wrapping the
//!   runtime's `VkImage`s as wgpu textures.
//! - [`graphics`]: the [`openxr::Graphics`] trait implementation that ties the
//!   Vulkan handles managed by wgpu into OpenXR.
//! - [`camera`]: conversion of per-eye view poses into [`libhelio::GpuCameraUniforms`].
//!
//! The `openxr` crate (0.21) has no built-in wgpu module, so [`graphics`]
//! implements [`openxr::Graphics`] against the raw Vulkan handles extracted
//! through wgpu's `as_hal()` escape hatch and wgpu-hal's `texture_from_raw`.
//! Both are inherently `unsafe`, backend-specific (Vulkan), and wgpu-version
//! specific; the exact wgpu APIs are pinned in `Cargo.lock` via the workspace.
//!
//! The crate only compiles for native targets; OpenXR requires a local runtime
//! and a VR headset, so everything is `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`.

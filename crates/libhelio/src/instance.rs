/// # When this is the right answer
///
/// Culling in this engine is driven by a single world-space bounding **sphere** per
/// instance ([`GpuInstanceData::bounds`]). That representation degrades badly for very
/// large or very flat geometry: a ground plane's sphere has a radius set by its diagonal,
/// so it is enormous relative to the geometry actually inside it, and it both fails to
/// cull anything useful *and* is easy to get wrong in the direction that deletes visible
/// geometry. For a handful of such objects — ground planes, skyboxes, an interior shell
/// the camera lives inside — testing them at all is worth less than the risk of testing
/// them wrongly.
///
/// # When it is not
///
/// This is an escape hatch, not a fix. An instance carrying this flag is submitted every
/// frame no matter where the camera looks, so setting it broadly gives back exactly the
/// GPU-driven culling this engine exists to do. If you find yourself setting it on many
/// objects, the real answer is almost always to split the geometry into pieces whose

/// case) pays one constant-buffer read and one extra `mat4x4` multiply per
/// vertex — no new pass, no branch, no separate pipeline.
///
/// Sublevels and portals are both just consumers of this one mechanism: a
/// sublevel assigns its members a space id once and moves the whole sublevel

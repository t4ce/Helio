//! Global wind state shared by every foliage shader.
//!
//! One [`GpuWind`] uniform drives grass blades, tree WPO and impostor cards. Sharing a
//! single uniform (rather than letting each pass derive its own time base) is what keeps
//! the three representations *in phase*: a blade at the L1/L2 cross-fade band is drawn
//! twice, once as geometry and once as a card, and if the two evaluated wind at even
//! slightly different times the stochastic cross-fade would show the silhouette shearing
//! against itself.
//!
//! The CPU-side mirror is [`Wind`], which owns the clock. Call [`Wind::advance`] exactly
//! once per simulated frame and upload [`Wind::to_gpu`]; the pair of timestamps that
//! produces is the whole reason this module exists (see [`GpuWind::time_prev_time`]).

//! GPU-facing per-portal render data.
//!
//! Derived by `helio::Scene` from SceneDB-owned portal components whenever a
//! portal is added, removed, or edited. The compact list is render topology,
//! while authored portal poses/openings and coordinate-space rows remain in
//! SceneDB. Consumed by `helio-pass-portal-cull` (frustum test to select
//! which instances get a duplicate draw) and `helio-pass-portal-instances`
//! (the duplicate draw itself, clipped to the portal's opening).

/// mapped through *chains* of portals, not just one at a time, so a portal
/// facing another (or itself, or a loop of several) shows real recursive
/// depth with zero manual authoring. 3 is a deliberately modest default —
/// chain count grows as `portal_count^depth`, and 3 already reads as
/// "infinite" to the eye for a small handful of portals (a 4th bounce is
/// usually too small/dim to distinguish from ambient falloff anyway). Raise
/// it if a scene's portals are large enough that a 4th bounce is legible.

/// that would exceed this budget is rejected transactionally; the renderer

/// instances survived, per chain — proportional to scene complexity × chain
/// count, unlike this list of plain index sequences). Keep this and those
/// crates' own per-chain capacity constants deliberately modest and sized
/// together, since their product is what actually gets allocated — the old

//! Test 5 (design §14.2, M3-b T8): the overflow clamp. Oversubscribes the
//! cull pass's command buffer -- more visible instances than the shader is
//! TOLD it may write (`CullUniforms.capacity`) -- and proves the whole
//! §14.2 safety story end to end: the atomic keeps counting true demand
//! past the bound, the shader never writes past it, the CPU-side
//! `min(count, capacity)` clamp is what makes the subsequent indirect draw
//! safe, and the silent-drop count is derivable and reportable.
//!
//! ## The logical/physical capacity split (the mechanism this test hinges on)
//!
//! [`CullOutputBuffers::new`] sizes the underlying `wgpu::Buffer` for
//! whatever `capacity` it is given -- call this the buffer's PHYSICAL
//! capacity. Separately, `CullUniforms.capacity` (written independently via
//! `CullPass::write_uniforms`) is the LOGICAL bound the shader actually
//! enforces (`wgsl.rs`'s `cull_main`: `if (out_slot < cull_uniforms.
//! capacity) { cull_output.records[out_slot] = ... }`). Nothing requires
//! these two numbers to match -- `records` is declared `array<CullRecord>`
//! (WGSL runtime-sized, its length implied by whatever buffer region is
//! bound), so the shader's only real bound is the uniform value.
//!
//! This test deliberately allocates a PHYSICAL buffer (`PHYSICAL_CAPACITY`)
//! LARGER than the LOGICAL bound it tells the shader (`LOGICAL_CAPACITY`),
//! specifically so there is real, GPU-addressable, in-bounds space past the
//! logical bound to plant canary bytes into. This is what makes the canary
//! check meaningful: a shader that ignored `cull_uniforms.capacity` and
//! instead wrote up to the buffer's actual physical extent (a real class of
//! bug -- reading the wrong bound, or comparing against `arrayLength`
//! instead of the uniform) would corrupt the canary region without ever
//! triggering a wgpu OOB validation error, because that region genuinely IS
//! inside the bound buffer. A canary planted in memory that was ALSO out of
//! the physical buffer's bounds would prove nothing new (wgpu's own
//! validation already forbids that unconditionally) -- the interesting,
//! test-worthy failure mode is exactly the in-bounds-but-past-the-logical-
//! limit one this split creates room for.
//!
//! `DEMAND` (the fixture's instance count, all mutually visible -- no
//! stale/oob/frustum-cull category exercised here, that is `cull_stale_and_
//! oob.rs`'s and `cull_pass.rs`'s job) sits strictly between `LOGICAL_
//! CAPACITY` (so the buffer really is oversubscribed) and `PHYSICAL_
//! CAPACITY` (so the canary region is never itself a plausible target row
//! -- the fixture simply does not have enough rows to fill it even if the
//! bound were ignored, keeping the corruption check unambiguous either
//! way).

//! Shared WGSL prelude.
//!
//! naga has no `#include`, and wgpu compiles a shader only at
//! `create_shader_module` — with a live device, at runtime. The combination is
//! why every pass ended up re-deriving the camera struct and the depth/NDC math
//! by hand, and why they drifted apart without anything catching it.
//!
//! The engine already composed shaders by string concatenation (see
//! `VHS_SHADER_SNIPPET` in the examples), so this follows the same approach
//! rather than pulling in a preprocessor.
//!
//! # Use
//!
//! Mark the shader, declare your own camera binding, drop the local copies:
//!
//! ```wgsl
//! //!use helio_prelude
//! @group(0) @binding(0) var<storage, read> cameras: array<Camera, 2>;
//! ```
//!
//! and build the module through [`module`] instead of `create_shader_module`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let shader = helio_core::shader::module(
//!     device,
//!     "SSR Trace Shader",
//!     include_str!("../shaders/ssr_trace.wgsl"),
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! Opting in is per-shader: a shader without the marker is passed through
//! untouched, so unmigrated passes that declare their own `Camera` keep working
//! (and would otherwise collide with the prelude's).
//!
//! # Caveat
//!
//! Prepending shifts line numbers, so naga diagnostics for a prelude-using
//! shader point into the combined source, offset by [`PRELUDE_LINES`]. That is
//! the price of concatenation over a real preprocessor; keeping the prelude small
//! and stable keeps it manageable.

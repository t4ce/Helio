//! GPU-visible foliage records: blade instances, tile headers and type descriptors.
//!
//! These three structs are the entire contract between `FoliagePlacePass` (which writes
//! blades and tiles) and `FoliageGBufferPass` (which reads them), and they are mirrored
//! field-for-field in WGSL. Their sizes are asserted at compile time in the style of
//! [`libhelio::meshlet`], because a size change that the shader does not follow does not
//! fail loudly — the shader reads every field from the wrong offset and you get a field
//! of grass with garbage rotations, which is a full day of debugging away from "someone
//! added a `u32`".
//!
//! # WGSL mirroring rules
//!
//! Declare these in WGSL using **scalar** fields, never `vec3<f32>`. WGSL gives `vec3`
//! a 16-byte alignment, so a single `vec3<f32>` in the middle of a struct silently
//! shifts every field after it and breaks the layout that these asserts are protecting.
//! `vec2<f32>` (8-byte aligned) and `vec4` are safe where the Rust offset is already
//! aligned to match; the per-field comments below say which is which.

/// One entry per *authored type* — not per instance. A scene has tens of foliage types,
/// so the whole table is a few kilobytes and stays permanently hot in L1 no matter how
/// often the placement and raster shaders read it. That is the fact that sets the size
/// policy for this struct: there is no measurable win from squeezing it, so every field
/// is stored in its natural form and nothing needs decoding on either side of the
/// CPU/GPU boundary.
///
/// # Why 96 and not 64
///
/// The plan's §4.3 heads this struct "64 bytes", but its own field list sums to **84** —
/// the header was simply wrong, and the fields are what matter. Rounding up to 96 leaves
/// 12 bytes of tail padding in [`GpuFoliageType::_pad`], which is **deliberate and meant
/// to be spent**: §4.3 is a first draft of what a foliage type needs, and this table will
/// grow. Fill the padding before widening the struct, and when it runs out grow to 128
/// rather than reintroducing packing.
///
/// The earlier draft of this type hit 64 bytes by storing `height_range`, `width_range`,
/// `slope_range` and `lod_distances` as `f16` pairs. That bought about two kilobytes —
/// nothing — and cost a decode on both sides, a standing risk that the WGSL
/// `unpack2x16float` path and the Rust packer disagree at some edge value, and a struct
/// with no room to grow. Packing is the wrong trade for a per-type table. It is the right
/// trade for [`GpuBladeInstance`], which is per-instance and multiplied by a million.
///
/// `altitude_range` is worth a specific note even now that everything is `f32`: it is the
/// one range here that can carry planetary magnitudes, and it must never be narrowed. At
/// 10 km, `f16` resolution is ±8 m — enough to move a treeline visibly. If a future
/// packing pass ever comes back to this struct, this is the field to leave alone.
///
/// # WGSL mirroring — every field is a scalar
///
/// **Declare all of these as scalars or `array<f32, N>` in WGSL. Not one of them may be
/// a vector type.** With this field order no member lands on the alignment a WGSL vector
/// requires: `height_range` at offset 4, `width_range` at 12, `slope_range` at 20 and
/// `altitude_range` at 28 are all misaligned for `vec2<f32>` (8), `lod_distances` at 36
/// is misaligned for `vec4<f32>` (16), and `wind_response` at 52 is misaligned for
/// `vec3<f32>` (16).
///
/// `wind_response` is the dangerous one, because it is the one someone will reach for
/// `vec3<f32>` on without thinking. WGSL gives `vec3<f32>` a 16-byte alignment, so that
/// single declaration would push the field from offset 52 to 64 and shift **every field
/// after it** — `interaction_stiffness`, `material_id`, `density_layer`,
/// `kind_and_flags` and `mesh_or_impostor_id` all read from the wrong offset. Nothing
/// crashes: trees render with a random material, foliage kinds resolve to the wrong
/// pipeline, and the cause is twelve bytes of padding rules in a language spec.

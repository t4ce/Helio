//! Bit-level packing primitives shared by the foliage GPU types.
//!
//! Every function here has a one-or-two-instruction WGSL equivalent
//! (`pack2x16unorm`, `pack4x8unorm`, `pack2x16float`, `unpack*`), and the placement
//! shader is expected to use the builtin rather than a hand-rolled port. These Rust
//! versions exist so the packing *contract* — which field lives in which half of which
//! `u32`, and what the quantisation endpoints are — is pinned by a test instead of by a
//! comment. If the WGSL and these functions ever disagree, the symptom is not a crash:
//! blades render at plausible-but-wrong positions, sizes or rotations, which reads as
//! "the placement shader is buggy" and costs a day to bisect. The round-trip tests at
//! the bottom of this file are the cheap version of that day.
//!
//! # Endpoint conventions
//!
//! Two different quantisation conventions are used deliberately and they are not
//! interchangeable:
//!
//! - **Unorm** ([`pack_unorm16`], [`pack_unorm8`]) divides by `2^n - 1`, so `0.0` and
//!   `1.0` both round-trip exactly. Used for tile-local position, scales and tint —
//!   values where both endpoints are meaningful and distinct.
//! - **Turns** ([`pack_yaw`]) divides by `2^n`, because an angle wraps: `0` and `2π` are
//!   the *same* orientation, so spending a code on both would waste a step and make the
//!   wrap point non-uniform. Using `65535` here would leave a visible seam of
//!   over-represented yaw near zero.

/// Quantise a `0.0..=1.0` value to 16-bit unorm.
///
/// Out-of-range inputs are clamped rather than wrapped: a candidate position that
/// escaped its tile by a hair should land on the tile edge, not teleport to the
/// opposite corner. Non-finite input yields `0`, because Rust's saturating float→int

//! CPU-side residency for the foliage tile ring.
//!
//! Owns the mapping between world tile coordinates and slots in the GPU tile table, and
//! decides which tiles are placed on any given frame. Deliberately GPU-free: everything
//! here is testable in a headless container, and the O(perimeter) property that the whole
//! foliage design rests on is a property of *this* file, not of the shaders.
//!
//! # The cost model this file is defending
//!
//! A ring of tiles around the camera is resident. On camera motion, only tiles crossing
//! the ring boundary change state, so the work per frame is proportional to the ring's
//! **perimeter**. [`TileRing::update`] enumerates exactly the entering and leaving strips
//! and nothing else, and records [`TileRing::last_visited`] so a test can assert the
//! bound rather than trusting a comment. The obvious "simpler" implementation — rebuild
//! the resident set from scratch each frame and diff it — renders identically and is
//! O(area); it would make a 128 m Medium ring cost 1024 coordinate visits per frame
//! instead of ~64, and nothing on screen would tell you.
//!
//! The one case that is genuinely O(area) is a teleport, where the new window does not
//! overlap the old at all. That is unavoidable and it is why placement is budgeted: the
//! entering tiles queue up and drain at [`TileRing::max_tiles_per_frame`], so a teleport
//! degrades to a few frames of progressive fill-in rather than a hitch.

//! Foliage tile residency, GPU placement, tile/cluster culling and per-LOD compaction.
//!
//! This is phase 2 of the foliage stack (plan §6, §10) and the producer half of the
//! grass path: it decides *which blades exist* and *which of them are visible this
//! frame*, and it hands `FoliageGBufferPass` four `draw_indirect` calls plus the buffers
//! those draws index. It draws nothing itself.
//!
//! # The one idea this pass is built around
//!
//! Regenerating every visible blade every frame is the common GPU-grass shortcut and
//! costs about a millisecond at a million blades. Instead the world is a grid of 8 m
//! tiles ([`helio_foliage_core::FOLIAGE_TILE_SIZE_METERS`]), a ring of them around the
//! camera is kept resident in a GPU arena, and placement only runs for tiles *entering*
//! the ring. Steady-state placement cost is therefore zero, and moving-camera cost is
//! proportional to the ring's **perimeter** rather than its area.
//!
//! That property is the entire design, so it is also the thing that is easiest to
//! destroy by accident. [`TileRing::update`] is written to touch only the strips that
//! actually changed and records [`TileRing::last_visited`] so a test can prove it —
//! a "simplification" that rebuilds the resident set each frame would still render
//! correctly and would quietly turn an O(perimeter) pass into an O(area) one.
//!
//! # Stages
//!
//! | Stage | Shader entry | Dispatch | Produces |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | 1. Placement | `cs_place` | one workgroup per queued tile, ≤ `max_tiles_per_frame` | `blade_arena`, `tile_table` |
//! | 2a. Tile cull | `cs_tile_cull` | one lane per ring slot | internal visibility mask |
//! | 2b. Cluster cull | `cs_cluster_cull` | one lane per 4×4 blade cluster | `visible_blades`, counters |
//! | 3. Finalize | `cs_finalize` | four lanes | `foliage_indirect` |
//!
//! All four are recorded on `ctx.encoder_ptr` — the **main render encoder** — and this
//! pass deliberately does not opt into `chain_transparent`. See the header of
//! `shaders/foliage_cull.wgsl` and the plan's §6.2 for why that is not a missed
//! optimisation but a correctness requirement about which frame's Hi-Z gets read.
//!
//! # Zero overhead when absent
//!
//! When `FrameResources::foliage` is unwritten — no foliage types registered —
//! [`RenderPass::prepare`] early-returns before touching a buffer and
//! [`RenderPass::execute`] records no commands at all. [`foliage_frame_is_present`] is
//! the single predicate both gate on, exposed so the guarantee can be asserted without a
//! GPU. [`FoliagePlacePass::commands_recorded`] counts the frames on which `execute`
//! actually recorded work.
//!
//! # Interface with `FoliageGBufferPass`
//!
//! Four `Arc<wgpu::Buffer>` fields are public and are meant to be cloned into the
//! consumer's constructor by the graph builder, exactly as `ShadowDirtyPass` hands its
//! buffers to `ShadowCullPass`:
//!
//! - [`FoliagePlacePass::blade_arena`] — `GpuBladeInstance[]`
//! - [`FoliagePlacePass::tile_table`] — `GpuFoliageTile[]`
//! - [`FoliagePlacePass::visible_blades`] — `u32` blade indices in four contiguous
//!   per-LOD regions, addressed with [`lod_region_offset`]
//! - [`FoliagePlacePass::foliage_indirect`] — exactly four
//!   [`wgpu::util::DrawIndirectArgs`] at byte offsets 0/16/32/48 in LOD order
//!
//! plus [`FoliagePlacePass::blades_per_tile`], which the consumer needs to recover a
//! blade's owning tile: the arena is partitioned into equal fixed slabs, so
//! `tile_slot = blade_index / blades_per_tile` is exact and O(1).

//! Uniform blocks shared with `shaders/foliage_place.wgsl` and `shaders/foliage_cull.wgsl`.
//!
//! Both are 64 bytes of plain scalars, and both sizes are pinned by a `const _` assert in
//! the style of `libhelio::meshlet`. A size or field-order change that the WGSL does not
//! follow does not fail loudly: the shader reads every field after the change from the
//! wrong offset, and the symptom is grass at the wrong density in the wrong places, which
//! reads as a placement bug rather than a layout one.
//!
//! Every field is a scalar for the same reason `GpuFoliageType` is: WGSL gives `vec3` a
//! 16-byte alignment and `vec2` an 8-byte one, so a single vector member can silently
//! shift everything after it. Keeping "all scalars, always" unconditionally true means no
//! future reorder can make a vector declaration *accidentally* correct and then break on
//! the reorder after that.

//! The eight-target pipeline contract.
//!
//! This is the plan's corrected §12 perf lever, and the part of it that is a *safety*
//! property rather than an optimisation. Grass writes five of the eight G-buffer
//! targets. The pipeline still declares all eight, because a pipeline's fragment targets
//! must match the render pass's colour attachments in count and format
//! (`RenderPassContext::check_compatible` compares them element-wise), so a five-target
//! pipeline would need its own render pass and forfeit the subpass fusion this pass is
//! positioned for.
//!
//! The three it does not write therefore carry `ColorWrites::empty()`. Without the mask
//! a declared target with no shader output has an **undefined** value, and the deferred
//! pass reads `sss` and `extra` for every pixel — so the failure is not "grass is
//! slightly wrong", it is "everything grass touches has garbage subsurface and
//! anisotropy parameters".

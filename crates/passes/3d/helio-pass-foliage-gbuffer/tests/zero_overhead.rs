//! The plan's §10 zero-overhead guarantee, asserted without a GPU.

//! Guarantee 2: "passes present but no foliage types registered ⇒ `prepare()`
//! early-returns on an unwritten `frame.foliage` slot, `execute()` records no commands,
//! `declare_resources` allocates nothing."
//!
//! This is exactly the kind of property that survives a refactor in spirit and dies in
//! practice: the cost of breaking it is a couple of constant-size buffer writes and four
//! empty draws, which nobody notices in a profile and nobody's eye catches in review.
//! `decide_frame` exists as a pure function so the guarantee has somewhere to be
//! asserted that does not need an adapter.

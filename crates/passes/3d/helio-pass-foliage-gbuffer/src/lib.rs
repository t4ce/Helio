//! Foliage G-buffer pass — grass blades and cards rasterised into the shared 8-target
//! G-buffer.
//!
//! Phase 2 of the foliage plan (`docs/foliage_rendering_plan.md`). This is the consumer
//! half of the grass pipeline: `FoliagePlacePass` decides *which* blades are visible and
//! at what LOD, and this pass turns those four compacted index lists into four
//! `draw_indirect` calls that fill albedo, normal, ORM, emissive and velocity.
//!
//! # Why it draws into the G-buffer and not a composite
//!
//! `BillboardPass` exists and would have been the cheap way to get vegetation on screen.
//! It composites into `pre_aa` *after* deferred lighting, so anything drawn through it
//! receives no shadows, no SSAO, no GI and no correct TAA. Foliage that does not go
//! through the G-buffer cannot be lit like the rest of the scene, and that is not a
//! quality knob — it is the difference between grass that sits in the world and grass
//! that floats on top of a screenshot of it.
//!
//! # Four draws, no vertex buffer, no index buffer
//!
//! `PrimitiveTopology::TriangleStrip`, `strip_index_format: None`, `cull_mode: None`,
//! and every vertex derived procedurally from `@builtin(vertex_index)`. Per-instance
//! strip restart is guaranteed by the WebGPU spec's primitive-assembly algorithm —
//! assembly runs per instance and a strip is split on the restart value only for
//! *indexed* draws — so a blade is one primitive with no degenerate stitch triangles.
//! `strip_index_format: None` has no effect on a non-indexed draw, but on Vulkan a
//! `Some` value sets `primitiveRestartEnable`, and `None` is the correct state here.
//!
//! Exactly four `draw_indirect` calls covers all the grass in the world on every
//! backend, including WebGPU, which has no `MULTI_DRAW_INDIRECT_COUNT`.
//!
//! # The 8-target pipeline with masked writes
//!
//! Grass writes neither `lightmap_uv`, `sss` nor `extra`, and the obvious optimisation —
//! a 5-target pipeline — is invalid. A pipeline's fragment targets must match the render
//! pass's colour attachments in count and format (`RenderPassContext::check_compatible`
//! compares the lists element-wise), so a 5-target pipeline needs its own render pass,
//! which forfeits subpass fusion. Breaking the chain forces a store and reload of every
//! touched attachment; at 1080p and 48 bytes/sample that is ~100 MiB each way on a
//! tile-based GPU, far more than the lever was ever going to save.
//!
//! So: all eight targets, identical formats to `GBufferPass`'s, and
//! [`wgpu::ColorWrites::empty()`] on the three grass does not write, with those
//! `@location`s omitted from the fragment shader. **The empty write mask is mandatory,
//! not cosmetic** — a declared fragment target with no shader output has an undefined
//! value, so without the mask those three G-buffer channels are filled with garbage
//! wherever grass covers a pixel, and the deferred pass reads them everywhere.
//!
//! # Zero overhead when absent
//!
//! When `frame.foliage` is unwritten, [`FoliageGBufferPass::prepare`] early-returns
//! before any upload and [`FoliageGBufferPass::execute`] records nothing. It still
//! returns `Some(descriptor)` from [`FoliageGBufferPass::render_pass_descriptor`]
//! whenever the G-buffer views exist. That is not an oversight: a pass that
//! conditionally returns `None` based on per-frame state can never participate in
//! subpass fusion, because the executor probes chain membership *once*, at lock time.
//! `BillboardPass` documents the same trap around `helio-pass-billboard/src/lib.rs:494`.
//!
//! # Pass order
//!
//! This pass must sit **immediately after `GBufferPass` and before
//! `VirtualGeometryPass`**, returning the byte-identical eight views in the same order.
//! Chain formation requires an exact attachment-view match
//! (`helio-core/src/graph/scheduling.rs:82-88`), and `VirtualGeometryPass` binds only
//! seven attachments — it omits `gbuffer_velocity` — so it can neither fuse with this
//! pass nor be skipped over by the chain scan (it is a raster pass, not
//! `chain_transparent`). Placing foliage after VG makes the fusion impossible.
